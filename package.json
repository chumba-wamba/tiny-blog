  "description": "A minimal, text-based web-application which allows you to create, read, update, and delete blogs. The intetion behind developing this project is to learn how to use Node.js and various other node libraries/frameworks such as Express.js, Handlebars, Mongoose, OAuth2 (with Passport), etc. The back-end relies on routers created using Express.js and the front-end is powered by HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS with the Handlebars as the templating engine. The future scope of the project is to replace the front-end with React.js or any other subsequent framework/library for better state management.",
